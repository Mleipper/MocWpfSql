# MocWpfSql

This is a simple WPF application to designed to connect to a MySql Database to allow the running of SQl queries without the need to have 
MYSql workBench open. 

This has enabled me to learn how to get data from a MySql DB using ADO and then to present this data in either a console or WPF application. 
This code to be extended to have a built in set of scripts for the user to access at to click of a button. 

I've taken what I have built here and used it as a template for a peice of work in my professional role.
